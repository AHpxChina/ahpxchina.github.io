First, let's get started by creating a new kotlin(java the same) project. Just select the Gradle template tab and check `Kotlin DSL build script`. By the way, if you just want a very simple try, just choose whatever you want `Additional Libraries and Frameworks`, and just keep the default package configuration.

As you can see, our project has been successfully initiated by the default way. And a simple `HelloWorld` kotlin file has been created.

It's time to release our HelloWorld project to people!

All our work based on the plugin [shadow](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow), so let's install it:
```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.5.21"
    id("com.github.johnrengelman.shadow") version "7.0.0" //you can modify the version here to the latest
}
```

The last configuration item is, append there's code to the end of the script file:
```kotlin
tasks.withType<com.github.jengelman.gradle.plugins.shadow.tasks.ShadowJar>() {
    manifest {
        attributes["Main-Class"] = "LauncherKt" //you must modify here to your own main class
                                                //note: if you are using kotlin like me, don't forget to 
                                                //append "Kt" as a suffix of the class name
    }
}
```

This is the final result of the jobs above, now we can start making our fat jar.

Check out the sidebar right side, you will found that there's a `shadow` section in the Gradle task list, right-click the section of `shadowJar`, and just waiting for the process to run out.

It's time to gain our reward, turn into `<your project directory>/build/lib`, have a look at the jar with `-all` suffix---that's what we exactly need to.

Now you can execute this artifact via java runtime:
```shell
java -jar F:\Demos\untitled\build\libs\untitled-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar <arguments, splitting with spaces>
```

Have fun, and enjoy!
